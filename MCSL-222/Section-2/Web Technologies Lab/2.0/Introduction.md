The _section-2_ of this lab manual is for **Web Technologies Lab**, which is based on **MCS-220 Web Technologies** course. At the end of this section, you will get list of lab
sessions. These ten lab sessions consist of several laboratory/ programming exercises which you have to implement/write code. For writing a program, you need to use IDE
(Integrated Development Environment) for better and smooth programming experiences. An IDE is an application that provides various application development
facilities for Programming Languages. It also provides many useful GUI tools which are useful for a developer's needs during application development. Some of the most
common features of IDEs are as follows:

  * Code Editor: It is designed for writing and editing the source code.
  * Compiler: It is used to transform source code written in a programming
  language (human readable/writable language) into a form that is executable
  by a computer.
  * Debugger: It is used during testing the application, which helps to debug
  application programs during the development.
  * Builder: This automates common developer tasks to build the application to
  run/execute the application.
  * Browsers:
  * Class Browser is used to examine and reference the properties of an
  object-oriented class hierarchy.
  * Object Browser is used to examine the objects instantiated in a
  running application program.
  * Class hierarchy Diagram: It allows the programmer to visualize the project
  structure of object-oriented programming code.

Manual development was the trend before the existence of IDEs;
developers/programmers used to write their programs manually in text editors t and
save the file with programming extension (like .java, .jsp, .vb, .c, .cc, etc.), then they
compile these file through a compiler which is installed and setup in the environment.
If program is compiled successfully, then it will be built and run on the applications
server. In case of the error messages shown during the compilation, they have to go
back to the text editor to revise the source code and recompile. IDE development has
made the program writing and compilation process simpler.

Some popular Java IDEs includes Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. In this
section, we will focus on these popular open-source IDEs. There are many other
IDEs also which support Java Programming Language. In this section of the lab
manual, we will talk about the use of the development environment of NetBeans,
Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea.
