Session-1
1. Create a simple point to point network topology using two nodes.
2. Create a UdpClient and UdpServer nodes and communicate at a fixed data 
rate.
Session - 2
3. Measure the throughput (end to end) while varying latency in the network 
created in Session -1.
4. Create a simple network topology having two client node on left side and 
two server nodes on the right side. Both clients are connected with another 
node n1. Similarly, both server node connecting to node n2. Also connect 
node n1 and n2 thus forming a dumbbell shape topology. Use point to point 
link only.
Session - 3 
5. Install a TCP socket instance connecting either of the client node with either 
of the server node in session 2’s network topology.
6. Install a TCP socket instance connecting other remaining client node with 
the remaining server node in session 2’s network topology.
7. Start TCP application and monitor the packet flow.
